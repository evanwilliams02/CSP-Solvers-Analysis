Constraint Satisfaction Analysis

Overview:
	For my final project, the two algorithms that I chose to use to solve my Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) were local search (Hill Climbing) and Backtracking. I chose these algorithms because I had some experience with them before and I felt like it was best to start with the basics. The CSPs that I chose to solve with these algorithms are Sudoku and Scheduled Delivery Routes. Although Sudoku and the crossword puzzle are easy to understand at a glance, the delivery routes are slightly different than both games but I will get into more detail later in the report.
